# DiceyMcDiceface

This repository contains a front end implementation of a dice rolling game leveraging the react javacript framework.

Included in this repository is an already transpiled script file. If you want to just see the final product and play the game, navigate to the url at the top of this repository. You can also go to that page [here](https://fangelod.github.io/DiceyMcDiceface/dist/)

If you would like to create the transpiled files on your own, it will require having `node` and `npm` installed. I would recommend using a version of `node` that provides a version of `npm` > 5. If you already have it installed you can follow these steps.

1. Clone the repository to a directory of your choice
1. Go into that directory and into the folder for the repository and perform an `npm install`
1. Once the dependencies have been downloaded into the `node_modules` folder you now need to perform an `npm run build`
1. After a successful build, open up the `index.html` in the `dist` folder in your preferred browser
1. Play the game!
